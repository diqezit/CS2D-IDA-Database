# CS2D Demangling (IDA)

This repository is my ongoing attempt to demangle / reverse engineer **CS2D.exe (x86, 32-bit)**.

Included files:
- `CS2D.exe.map` — MAP file used as an additional symbol source
- `CS2D.exe.7z` — archived IDA database CS2D.exe.i64 (I couldn't compress/export it from IDA due to an error, so I packed it manually with 7-Zip)
- `CS2D.exe.lst.7z` — archived `.lst` listing file

Most of the main paths/modules are already demangled, but a large part is still work in progress and will be updated over time (math - images - sounds - library like blitz3d/blitz max and etc.)

## Legal / Ownership
I do **not** distribute `CS2D.exe` here — you must use your own legally obtained copy that matches the exact version this database was made for.

All rights to CS2D, including the original code and related assets, belong to the original authors/owners.
